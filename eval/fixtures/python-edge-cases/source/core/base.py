# --- Static Analysis Expected ---
#
# Defined entities:
#   Classes (5): SwimmingMixin, Animal, Dog, Cat, Duck
#   Methods (8): SwimmingMixin.swim, Animal.__init__, Animal.speak (abstract),
#                Animal.__str__, Animal.__repr__, Dog.speak, Dog.fetch (@staticmethod),
#                Dog.create (@classmethod), Cat.speak, Duck.speak, Duck.actions
#                (note: overridden names like "speak" collapse to one reference key)
#
# Expected call edges (from method bodies):
#   __repr__      -> __str__       (self.__str__())
#   create        -> Dog/__init__  (cls(name) — classmethod constructor call)
#   actions       -> speak         (self.speak())
#   actions       -> swim          (self.swim())
#
# Class hierarchy:
#   Animal(ABC)              — abstract base class, superclass of Dog, Cat, Duck
#   Dog(Animal)              — single inheritance
#   Cat(Animal)              — single inheritance
#   Duck(Animal, SwimmingMixin) — multiple inheritance
#   SwimmingMixin            — mixin, subclassed by Duck
